# Foreword

Hello there! I'm Oscar (Ozwild) and this is my personal online resume, well the code that is.
It's purpose, apart from the obvious, was to get a better grasp on JS templating and css preprocessors.
To this end I started this as a CodePen project using Pug and Stylus but somewhere along the way I decided it was worth to have it available as a repository on github.

This is by no means a proper formal resume, this is just a way to show off, to showcase creativity and expertise. Hence, you'll be able to notice the lack of consideration for cpu/memory usage thereof. It's ok, it's just a concept resume of sorts.

So, without any further ado. I give to you.... 

**The Resume.**

# On with business

## Features
 * Static single page application
 * Requires Javascript to run animations
 * Fallbacks gracefully when Javascript is disabled

## See it live

## Usage

### Before starting:
* Resume requires Pug, Stylus and Webpack .
* Pug, Stylus and Webpack (like pretty much any other thing nowadays) require npm
* npm requires NodeJS...

You get the picture. So read the rest and then go grab what you need.

- Pug (https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
- Stylus (https://github.com/stylus/stylus/)
- Webpack (https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

I know this might be troublesome but the whole idea is to get some hands-on practice with these tools.

### Moving on

1. Clone or download this repository
1. Edit contents @views/content/
1. (optional) Change nav titles @views/layouts/_nav.pug
1. (optional) Add individual backgrounds @views/_backgrounds.pug
1. (optional) Change/Add background colors @resources/styles/content/components/_backgrounds.styl
1. (optional) Use webpack to process @resources/scripts/app.js, if you decided to change anything in there
1. (optional) Use stylus to process @resources/styles/app.styl, if you decided to change any of the styles
1. Use pug on @index.pug to get a new @index.html compiled
1. Use whatever server you like to serve the repository
 
 Aaand... there it is. Your very own resume project fresh out of the oven.
 You could alternatively just modify the contents of the index.html file provided but where's the fun in that?
